# BinaryTreeFunctions

Implementing a B-tree in Python 
Step 1 - BSTNode Class 
Our implementation won’t use a Tree class, but instead just a Node class. Binary trees are really just a pointer to a root node that in turn connects to each child node, so we’ll run with that idea.

First, we create a constructor:

Step 2 : Insert 
Step 3 - Get Min and Get Max
